# ego-localization-system
Baidu ego localization system is an accurate ego localization solution for self-driving. By combining sensor information, Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), and Baidu HD Map into one system, Baidu ego localization system is able to offer a localization solution with high accuracy.  GNSS positioning observes range measurements from orbiting GNSS satellites, while GNSS in general has some restrictions that it may not be available for high accuracy requirements of self-driving. Baidu ego localization system combines sensor information with HD Map and GNSS solution to provide high-accuracy localization solution. System extracts features from sensors and Baidu HD Map for feature matching. After feature matching, system is able to locate current vehicle in HD Map. Motion compensation is proposed to compensate current localization solution.
